The Trump administration is launching another offensive against Washington, D.C. — a city President Donald Trump has long insulted and sought to overhaul — this time over allegations of a “lukewarm” response from D.C. officials to rising threats of antisemitism in the nation’s capital.

Leo Terrell, the chair of the Department of Justice’s Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, slammed Mayor Muriel Bowser for her “lukewarm response” to a “crisis” of antisemitism in the city in a series of posts to his X account this week.

Terrell posted a back-and-forth with Bowser’s office over his request to meet directly with the mayor to discuss rising antisemitism in the city — including what he said were “Jewish taxes” levied against the community in the form of increased security costs.

Local Jewish leaders have acknowledged an increase in security costs — even as the head of an organization focused on security for Jewish institutions in the Washington area told POLITICO that efforts to work with federal crime data teams have been stymied due to “a reallocation of resources.”

The targeted and pointedly publicized attack on D.C. leadership marks a renewed assault from the Trump administration against the District. Trump, who repeatedly floated a federal takeover of Washington during his first administration, revisited the idea on Tuesday when he suggested during a Cabinet meeting that “we could run D.C.”

Terrell’s decision to turn his task force’s focus to the nation’s capital also comes after the murder of two Israeli Embassy staffers outside the Capital Jewish Museum in May sent shock waves through the local community and prompted D.C.-area Jewish religious and community centers to bolster their security apparatuses.

“There’s been a disturbing rise in antisemitic violence in Washington, DC,” Terrell wrote in a post accompanying a photograph of the initial letter he sent to the mayor. “I saw blood being wiped off the sidewalk outside the Capital Jewish Museum after a domestic terrorist murdered Israeli embassy staffers. Jewish community members are facing threats, intimidation — and in some cases, are being forced to pay outrageous ‘Jewish taxes’ just to get security and feel safe.”

Terrell’s task force gained influence as the driving force behind the federal investigations into prominent universities over alleged cover-ups of antisemitism on their campuses, leading to significant cuts in federal funding that ignited a legal battle over the move.

Bowser has tried to play nice with Trump in his second term, hoping to stave off more aggressive attacks on the city. But when a representative from the mayor’s office directed Terrell to meet with specific officials tasked with handling the issues in question rather than the mayor herself, Terrell appeared to suggest that Bowser was attempting to brush him off.

“A lukewarm response to a crisis that demands bold leadership!” Terrell said, posting a photograph of the email response from the mayor’s office, before sharing his office’s response pushing to meet directly with the mayor and vowing to “keep the White House informed about the meeting.”

Bowser’s office acknowledged but did not otherwise respond to multiple requests for comment, and the DOJ declined to comment further on Terrell’s posts and letters.

While Terrell repeatedly described increased security costs as “Jewish taxes,” the executive director of JShield, the security division of the Jewish Federation of Greater Washington, emphasized that “the term ‘Jewish tax’ isn’t one used in our community” — but said its likely intended meaning still rings true.

“In the D.C. context, the ‘Jewish tax’ reflects a real and ongoing cost of being Jewish in an environment where safety cannot be taken for granted,” JShield’s Rusty Rosenthal said, adding that “Jewish communities have had to significantly increase spending on security infrastructure in response to persistent threats.”

Although some funding is available through “various levels of government,” it’s “rarely sufficient to meet the full scope of needs,” Rosenthal said, noting that “due to limited resources and high competition,” some organizations receive funding while others do not.

A lack of funding isn’t the only obstacle in the D.C. area’s efforts to address antisemitism-related security issues — federal support for local initiatives has also been recently curtailed due, Rosenthal said, to resource reallocation.

JShield had been in “discussions to collaborate with the FBI’s crime data team,” he told POLITICO in an email via a spokesperson, but that the meeting between the agency and security team was “cancelled when the FBI team was directed not to engage.”

In a subsequent message, a spokesperson for JShield said the security operation “understood that a reallocation of resources led to a pause in discussions,” adding that “overall, JShield has experienced excellent liaison and cooperation with the FBI on rising antisemitism in the DC area.”

The FBI acknowledged a question from POLITICO on the meeting, but did not immediately provide comment for this story.
